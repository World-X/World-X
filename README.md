## Hello there ðŸ‘‹
Howdy, my name is â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ, but you can call me World. I hope you can understand why I want to keep my real name private, at least for now.
Anyways, I'm from Mexico, and I'm an aspiring software engineer and college student.

  - A portfolio website to showcase some projects I've worked on, plan to work on, and learn more about me.
  - A "The World's Hardest Game" fangame written in C.

  - Low level programming, using C and C++. I will probably learn Rust and Zig too in the future.
  - C# with Blazor, JavaScript for web development, Python, among other high level languages.
  - Of course, I also know HTML and CSS.
  - I used to code in GDScript using Godot.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
  - Simple projects so I can get started with open source collaboration. I've never done this before, but I'm willing to give it a try and learn.
  - It would be fun to work on a tiny videogame, tool or webpage.

  - I want to master C! Or well, become decently good at it.
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
  - The first programming language I ever used was Python, back in 2018 or so.
  - I've used Godot for 3+ years! Although it's been a while since I've used it, and I wasn't particularly good at it, but it got me more into programming.
  - My current favorite programming language is C! I initially hated it, but now I love it, I learned a lot thanks to C, and my whole perspective on programming changed a lot too.
